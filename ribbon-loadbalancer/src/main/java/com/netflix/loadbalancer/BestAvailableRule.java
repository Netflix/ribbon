/**
 * A rule that skips servers with "tripped" circuit breaker and picks the
 * server with lowest concurrent requests.
 * <p>
 * This rule should typically work with {@link ServerListSubsetFilter} which puts a limit on the 
 * servers that is visible to the rule. This ensure that it only needs to find the minimal 
 * concurrent requests among a small number of servers. Also, each client will get a random list of 
 * servers which avoids the problem that one server with the lowest concurrent requests is 
 * chosen by a large number of clients and immediately gets overwhelmed.
